# Evaluating Fairness for Semi-supervised Learning Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Image Segmentation

## UniMatch

A semi-supervised model was trained on the ACDC and UKBB datasets and analyzed for bias. This experiment is available [here](https://github.com/msskzx/unimatch).

## FCT

A supervised model was trained on the ACDC and UKBB datasets and analyzed for bias. This experiment is available [here](https://github.com/msskzx/fct).


## ACDC Dataset

Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge Dataset available [here](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/index.html).

Visualizations, analysis were performed to get a better understanding of the dataset.

## UK Biobank Dataset

UK Biobank (UKBB) Dataset available [here](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/).
